This is module to verify if rollback procedure was executed correctly.
Basically two dictionaries are being compared:
    - pre_data: data collected from SRC and DST clusters, is being stored in
                file with name which is described in config file.
    - data_after: data collected from SRC and DST clusters using data_collector
                  module, it is being stored in memory as dictionary.
